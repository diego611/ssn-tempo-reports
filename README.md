# Chrome extension to make our time tracking reports look a bit better

This tiny Chrome extension injects some CSS to our print views of [Tempo](http://tempo.io/) reports to make them look _better_. Both by removing a couple of _unnecessary_ rows/cols and adding some style rules.

A bit dirty, but just works.

##Usage

- Download the extension
- Go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser
- Drop the folder there
